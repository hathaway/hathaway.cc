My name is [Ben Hathaway](about/). I'm an engineer and I build software products. When I'm not building software, I run OCRs and build things in the real world.

I've been building software since 2003 when I released my first software product from my dorm room on the campus of the University of Cincinnati. That was Product Idea Profitability Evaluator. It was a mouthful so we called it "PIPE". PIPE used real time bid data feeds from paid search engines to evaluate the online market potential of a product idea.

I launched my second company and first [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) product, Mortgage Web Success, in 2004 while I was finishing up my Computer Engineering degree. Mortgage Web Success was a fully integrated online marketing system designed specifically for mortgage and loan professionals to give them an online presence that generated new business. Some of its main features included a hosted website, content management system, CRM, secure online loan application, and marketing automation system.

In 2008, I invested in and joined [Mailprotector][mailprotector] as the Director of Development. Shortly after that I became the CTO and have enjoyed serving in that role ever since. We've done a lot over the last 10 years. Read more about that here.

In addition to building software, I like to stay active. Back in 2012 I started running obstacle course races. My first was a Tough Mudder in October 2012 and I immediately became hooked. Since then I have run xxx races totaling xxx miles. Spartan, Tough Mudder, GORUCK Nasty, Superhero Scramble. You can see the full list here. My goal is to continue running at least one race every year until my boys are old enough to run them with me. This year my oldest two ran their first Spartan Race so they are getting close.
