## This site is built and hosted using several third party tools and services.

Produced using the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor, my editor of choice since it was released in 2015.

Published with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com), and the site is hosted on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) while using [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) as a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) for security, high availability, and performance. Domains use Amazon Route 53 for DNS.

[Bookshelf](/bookshelf/) uses the [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/) and links to Amazon (of course).

[OCRs](/races/) use coordinates to link to [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/about) for historical weather information and [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/) for location information.

Design uses [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).
