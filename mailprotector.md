In 2010, we rolled out a ground up rebuild of the Mailprotector infrastructure. This rebuild was focused on moving the architecture to linux based systems, moving away from .NET and Windows servers. This new architecture did wonders for the performance and reliability of the Mailprotector infrastructure and gave us a new foundation to begin building new services and features on.
