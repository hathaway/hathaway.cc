Why is it we describe the things we _want_ to do in life as important instead of necessary?

The definition of important is “marked by or indicative of significant worth or consequence” while the definition of necessary is “of an inevitable nature” or “absolutely needed”.

Instantly you can see the difference between the two words.

Look at the things that you do on a regular basis. A normal day will most likely involve you eating, going to work, and sleeping. Why is it that we do these things?

Because they are **necessary**.

If you decide that it isn’t necessary to go to work, then you won’t go. But the consequence of that decision is probably going to be losing your job.

So lets face it, what we do on a daily basis are things that are necessary.

### How do you describe your dreams?

Things that you want to do are typically considered important but not necessary. That’s why they never get done. Until something makes the jump from important to necessary, you will never get to it. There are simply too many other necessary things in life to get to those that are _just_ important.

It’s easy for someone to say that something is important to them. Important leaves room for it not to happen. You can always get to the important things tomorrow.

But when something becomes necessary, you will stop at nothing to make sure it happens. It must happen and it must happen now. Why? Because it is necessary.

History has shown that humans are capable of accomplishing the most amazing things. But in each circumstance, you will find one common factor, necessity. If you are having trouble getting what you want out of life, chances are, that something is only **important** to you, not **necessary**.

### How can you make sure you accomplish more of your dreams?

That is simple, make your dreams and goals something that is necessary to you. Only then will it become a high enough priority in your life to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

If you can ask yourself the question “Is this something that I **have to do**?” and can honestly answer “Yes”, then that is not only important but necessary. You have made the first step to making it happen.

Can you change the way you think?

You are where you are in life because of the priorities you have and had. In order to change your life, you must change the way you think and prioritize. So the question really should not be _can_ you change the way you think but rather…

### Will you change the way you think?

Once you have made this decision, you will think about your dreams differently. You finally put them higher on your list of priorities. They will no longer only be important to you but now they will be necessary.

Are your dreams inevitable?
