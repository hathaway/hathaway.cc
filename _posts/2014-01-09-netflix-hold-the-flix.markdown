> I’ve long had a love affair with Netflix. But perhaps more so than any other service, the relationship has changed over time. Not in a bad way, necessarily — it’s just different. And it’s different, because Netflix is different. It’s a service that keeps re-inventing itself.

> That should be obvious to anyone paying attention. But it took [this post by Felix Salmon](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/01/03/netflixs-dumbed-down-algorithms/) to point out the obvious to me: in its transition to full-on streaming, Netflix is no longer about movies.

> Said another way: Netflix has ramped up the “net” and wound down the “flix”.
