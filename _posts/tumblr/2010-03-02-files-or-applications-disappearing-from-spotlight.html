<p>Occasionally, the Spotlight search results will not show files or applications that they used to show or will stop working altogether. Sometimes a simple reboot will fix the problem but in case that doesn&rsquo;t work, here are the steps to clear out your Spotlight index and force it to reindex your file system.</p>
<p>Delete the current index</p>
<p>To delete the Spotlight index, open up the Terminal app and type in the following:</p>
<pre>sudo rm -r /.Spotlight-V&lt;tab&gt;</pre>
<p>Note: Do not type in the &lt;tab&gt; part. That is to force the Terminal app to load whatever your index folder is into the command.</p>
<p>How to make Spotlight reindex your file system</p>
<p>To force Spotlight to reindex your file system, use the Terminal app to run the following commands:</p>
<pre>sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist
sudo mdutil -E /
</pre>
<p>Give it some time to reindex your file system. You&rsquo;ll notice the processors working hard during this time. Depending on the amount of file on your system, this may take a few minutes or an hour or two.</p>
