<p>One of the primary features of the Mac OS X operating system is their search feature called <strong>Spotlight</strong>. Many Mac OS X users depend on this great feature but others don&rsquo;t find it necessary. For those of you who don&rsquo;t find it necessary, it can improve the performance of your Mac OS X system if you disable it.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these simple steps.</p>
<p>Note that some other Mac OS X features and programs are based on Spotlight’s search abilities, therefore some applications could behave abnormally if you disable Spotlight, particularly in search functions.</p>
<p><em>Important: These instructions were created based on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. They may work on previous or future versions of OS X but they may not.</em></p>
<ol><li>Launch Terminal and type the following command: <code>sudo nano /etc/hostconfig</code></li>
<li>Find the following entry in the hostconfig file: <code>SPOTLIGHT=-YES-</code></li>
<li>Change <code>SPOTLIGHT=-YES-</code> to <code>SPOTLIGHT=-NO-</code></li>
<li>Save /etc/hostconfig by hitting Control-O and the return key. Next hit Control-X to exit the nano editor.</li>
<li>Disable the Spotlight index by typing the following in the Terminal:<br/><code>sudo mdutil -i off /</code></li>
<li>To erase the current Spotlight index, type: sudo <code>mdutil -E /</code></li>
<li>When you reboot, Spotlight will be completely disabled.</li>
