<p>If you need to create an S3 bucket and give access to a single user, here is the custom policy to get that done.</p>
<p>You add this to a users you have created in IAM by going to the `Permissions` tab for that user and selecting `Attach User Policy`. Choose the `Custom Policy` option and paste the following.Â </p>
<p>You will want to customize the &ldquo;my-bucket&rdquo; parts to match the name of your bucket.</p>
<pre>{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
    },
    {
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}</pre>
