<p>This is another common administrative task I find myself needing to do on Linux or Unix machines. Typically I&rsquo;ll have a log file that has grown large that I want to empty but without removing and recreating the file. This simple command does that.</p>
<pre>cat /dev/null &gt; filename.log</pre>
