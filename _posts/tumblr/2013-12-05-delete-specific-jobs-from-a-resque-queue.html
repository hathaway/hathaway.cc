<p>This is a handy little piece of code in case you have jobs of a certain type that you want deleted from your Resque queues. The <a href="http://rubydoc.info/github/defunkt/resque/Resque/Job#destroy-class_method" target="_blank"><code>Resque.destroy</code></a> method allows you to define the queue to clean up and the class name of the job type you want removed.</p>
<p>The following call will remove all jobs of class &lsquo;UpdateGraph&rsquo;:</p>
<p><code>Resque::Job.destroy(queue, 'UpdateGraph')</code></p>
<p>You can also specify arguments to filter out certain jobs of that type:</p>
<p><code>Resque::Job.destroy(queue, 'UpdateGraph', 'foo')</code></p>
<p>Keep in mind the performance of this function is not fast:</p>
<blockquote>This method can be potentially very slow and memory intensive, depending on the size of your queue, as it loads all jobs into a Ruby array before processing.</blockquote>
