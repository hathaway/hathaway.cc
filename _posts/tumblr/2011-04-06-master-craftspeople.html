<p>At 37signals, however, we have a different position on ambition. We&rsquo;re not big fans of what I consider &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; ambition—that is, the usual career-path trajectory, in which a newbie moves up the ladder from associate to manager to vice president over a number of years of service. On the other hand, we revere &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; ambition—in which employees who love what they do are encouraged to dig deeper, expand their knowledge, and become better at it. We always try to hire people who yearn to be master craftspeople, that is, designers who want to be great designers, not managers of designers; developers who want to master the art of programming, not management.</p>

<p>I love the idea of a group of people working together that are all master craftspeople at what they do.</p>
