<p>Here is another command to add to the list of administrative commands I frequently need on Linux. To easily view the size of the directories in the directory you are currently in sorted by size, run the following.</p>
<p><code>du --block-size=MiB --max-depth=1 | sort -n</code></p>
<p>This command lists the directories with their sizes in megabytes and sorts the results by size in ascending order. If you prefer to sort in descending order, use this command.</p>
<p><code>du --block-size=MiB --max-depth=1 | sort -rn</code></p>
